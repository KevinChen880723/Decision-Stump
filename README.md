# Decision-Stump

## Description
This is the code of Machine Learning Foundation course's HW2.
The purpose of the project is to implement Decision Stump, which is one dimension's PLA.
We can change the size of training data set and the noise level.
So we can observe how does these hyper-parameter affect the error between Eout(g)-Ein(g).
